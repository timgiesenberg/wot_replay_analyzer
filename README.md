wot_replay_analyzer
===================

Watch the replay folder and collect the data represented by file names.

Currently in development, handles mockup Data.

Thoughts on MoSCoW, 01.10.2014, list may be extended later on.

#### Must
* select a directory where wotreplays are to find
* scan directory and subdirectory for *.wotreplay files
* display all collected data in a Tableview
* table is sortable
* occurances like maps and tanks are counted and displayed

#### Should
* save data as a json/xml file
* read data from a json/xml file
* add screenshots to a replay object
* remember last opened directory (application store? / generadted file?)


#### Could
* add video links to your replay
